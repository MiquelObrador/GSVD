## ðŸš€ Ready-to-Use System

The improved system now provides:

1. **Professional-grade error handling** - Won't crash on common issues
2. **Progress tracking** - Know exactly what's completed and what's remaining  
3. **Resumption capability** - Continue interrupted long-running evaluations
4. **Comprehensive logging** - Debug issues and track performance
5. **Publication-ready output** - Professional plots and analysis
6. **Easy configuration** - Clear parameters and documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Workflow

```bash
# 1. Quick test (optional)
python test_evaluation_system.py

# 2. Configure paths in run_thoughput.sh
nano run_thoughput.sh  # Update MODEL_BASE and UPDATED_MODEL_PATH_TEMPLATE

# 3. Run comprehensive evaluation
./run_thoughput.sh

# 4. Analyze and visualize results
pip install -r analysis_requirements.txt  # Optional, for plotting
python analyze_throughput_results.py throughput_results_*/evaluation_results.jsonl

# 5. Review outputs
ls throughput_results_*/     # Results and logs
ls analysis_output/          # Plots and statistics
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

You now have a production-ready throughput evaluation system that can:
- Handle failures gracefully
- Track progress and resume interrupted runs  
- Generate publication-quality plots
- Provide comprehensive analysis and debugging information
- Scale to large parameter sweeps reliably

The system is ready for generating the throughput graphs you need for your research!
